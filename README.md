# rotating_cube
Basicaly, the code make a cube that rotate in space and print it in the scream. In the future i will make an interactive menu to print some other geometric forms, but if you know rust and want some other thing, keep in mind that there are three geometric figures: cube, pyramid and ruby (see the code to more information).
